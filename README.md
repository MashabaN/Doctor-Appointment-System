# Doctor-Appointment-System Description: 
Our project, Appoint your Doctor, is a doctor appointment web-based application made with Laravel, motivated to reduce the hectic and time consuming system of appointing doctors. Here we are offering more than twenty features under five basic requirements. We are following MVC architecture to construct the project. Hopefully this project will be able to add some value in our society.
 The booking application has three types of users namely patient, doctor, and admin.
The patient will be able to book an appointment with his doctor. In the frontend, we have a date through which the patient can filter the available doctors on a particular date.  He can book a schedule  for a particular date which will be also shown in the patient dashboard later. If yes, he will see the medicine prescribed by the doctor on his dashboard. He can also update his profile.
Admin can filter the patients and see who has booked an appointment on a particular date. Admin can create departments and update and delete them. As an admin, he can get the information about the system on his dashboard. The information such as how many doctors are working in his clinic? How do patients make appointments? How many departments are in the clinic? etc.
As a doctor, he can create an appointment time for a particular date. He can create e-prescriptions. He can update the time slot as well. Moreover, doctors can cancel the appointment.He can check how many patients have made an appointment on a particular date by filtering through the date.
